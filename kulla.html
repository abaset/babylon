[Title]

Exorcising Kulla (the brick god) from a newly built house
[Alternate Title]

SBTU 2, no. 16
[Akkadian Title]


[Translation]

(The brick god) Kulla with his provisions (is put) in a boat provided with sails. They dispatch him on the river, and as soon as he is dispatched, the exorcist speaks as follows:
Incantation:
„Kulla, you are torn out, driven away and expelled. Kulla, you are conjured by heaven and you are conjured by the netherworld, you are conjured by Ea and Marduk, you are conjured by Duri and Dari, you are conjured by Lahma and Lahama, you are conjured by Alala and Belili, you are conjured by the gods residing in heaven, you are conjured by the gods residing in the netherworld! You are conjured by the Apsû, you are conjured by the gods residing on the Sacred Mount! You shall be torn out, you shall go away, you shall depart, you shall withdraw, you shall move out! I conjure you by Ekur and Gar – you shall never return!"
Instruction:
The exorcist and the builder turn their faces away. Seven tablets (?) at the right site, seven tablets (?) at the left site are thrown into the river. For three days the builder must not enter the house.
[Explanatory Notes]

The ritual describes how both divine and human builders have to leave the construction site after the building’s completion. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brick god and divine builder Kulla, a son of Enki/Ea and his wife Damgalnunna/Damkina, is sent away on the river like an evil demon. The gods by whom Kulla is conjured are primeval deities and belong to the ancestors of Anu.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One may wonder why Kulla, who had supervised the building process from its beginning was now driven away in such an unfriendly manner and the human architect had to refrain from entering the building at least for a certain period of time. The presence of divine and human builders implied, of course, the performance of building work, and this, again, meant existing damage to be repaired–a situation to be avoided by all means.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kulla was not always expelled in such a harsh way. There is a group of incantations directed to the brick-god and his colleague, the divine architect Mushdama, in which both of them are asked to return joyfully and under the rejoicing of the gods of the Apsû to their father Enki/Ea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A remarkable parallel to this can be found in the 3rd millennium BC in the inscriptions of Gudea of Lagash. The ruler describes how he made Mushdama (written without divine determinative and thus perhaps a wordplay referring both to the divine architect and his human colleagues) leave the temple Eninnu before the solemn entry of the god Ningirsu into his house (Cyl. B iii 16f.; H. Neumann, CRRA 40, p. 158.).

[Title]

Laying the foundations of a house
[Alternate Title]

K 3664+ obv. 1-15 and 17-21
[Akkadian Title]


[Translation]

If you are laying the foundations of a man’s house, at sun[rise] you set up a basin for holy water. Into the basin for holy water you throw silver, [gold], juniper, syrup, ghee and pressed oil. You arrange a ritual arrangement for Ea, Shamash and Asalluhi and [perform] a sacrifice. You set up an adagurru-container, you arrange one ritual arrangement for the god (variant: king). You sacrifice a [ram] over the foundation trench; syrup, beer, wine, oil and oil of first quality you libate o[ver the foundation] and [do you pour] into the foundations.
Incantation:
Kulla (the brick god), lord of foundation and wall – oh you! NN, son of NN, who is building this house, by [your] command, by your word may he prosper! Because you are merciful, I have turned [to you], because you are merciful, I seek [you]! The house he has built may last for a long time. This evil of the house [...], you [avert] death, loss and evil deed from this house. At your sublime command, which cannot be altered, and by your firm consent, which cannot be changed, may NN, son of NN, live, prosper and sing your praises.
(Ritual Instruction)
(...) You deposit arsuppu-grain, garden-pea, wheat, grain at its highest growth, emmer, seed of all kinds, silver, gold, carnelian, lapis lazuli, juniper, [juniper] seed, the fragrant plant sumlalu, fragrant balluku-wood, „sweet reed", a white cloth, a black cloth, a linen cloth and a [red] cloth under the foundations and go away. The evil of the house is removed, the said house will obtain a protective deity and a protective genius, the proprietor of the said house will grow old.
[Explanatory Notes]

This ritual texts offers an explanation as to how and why various substances can be as a deposit in the foundation trenches of excavated building. &lt;br /&gt;During the performance of the ritual, an incantation was addressed to Kulla, the brick god and divine builder. Kulla was a son of Enki/Ea and his wife Damgalnunna/Damkina. Kulla supervised the building process from the beginnings until completion and was then sent away.&lt;br /&gt;The phrase „you deposit under the foundation“ means that the various substances were scattered in the foundation trenches before the foundations were laid or that they were scattered between the gaps of the first layer of bricks.&lt;br /&gt;
