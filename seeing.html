is an <i>active</i> power. We are used to thinking of it as a passive
activity, something that happens <i>to</i> us - light enters our eyes
and tells us what's there. But it takes long and careful training in
childhood to learn to discern what is important or relevant in our
surroundings, focus upon those things and <i>see</i> them. Babies
have no power to focus their retinas at birth, but they develop the
power within a few months. It's a matter of survival. Parents know
babies are developing normally when they can follow our hand with
their eyes. A similar process occurs with all the senses. The senses
are <i>trained</i>, they do not just <i>happen</i>.<br/>
For example,
in a place neither of you has been before, you may look up at the sky
and see nothing but a few clouds; a meteorologist will see three
types of clouds, the interaction of pressure fronts, the general
quality of the atmosphere, and can predict the weather for the next
few days or weeks. Not to mention possibly the latitude and
longitude, the local geography for the surrounding few hundred miles,
the time of year, and the exact time of day to within half an hour.
Theoretically, you both have the same information coming to you; but
you cannot exploit the information because you can't <i>see</i> as
much - your eyes and other senses haven't been <i>trained</i> to see
it. So you really don't see what the meteorologist sees. Another way
to put it is that you don't know what the meteorologist knows. The
more you <b>know</b> the more you can <b>see</b>; and when you have
seen more you can know more.</font></font></font></p>

<font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Magick
trains you to see what you haven't seen before, and to look again at
what you don't know you're already seeing. The magickal world
everyone has already seen is that of dreams and daydreams, memory,
fiction, and creative visualization. Everyone experiences these
things to some degree. Magick is not limited to these realms, but
these are the experiences that make magick tangible for most people.
It is the world of the imagination. Your imagination is a sense.</font></font></font></p>

<font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">This
bears repeating. <b>Your imagination is a sense</b>, which brings you
information on different dimensions of reality. It is not a
trash-can, and it is not less real than any other reality you have
worked hard to establish. Common reality is as much a function of
your imagination as dreams are. The magickal adventure of course
works in all levels of reality, but the first task is to learn to
trust yourself, to discover your point of view, and this is only
possible by learning to listen to the reality that is most private,
most secret, your own imagination. You must learn to <i>see with your
mind</i>. You must learn to <i>focus</i> the mind's eye, to <i>discern</i>
the reality it is pointing to. You must be patient, because reality
only opens its secrets to knowledge, and knowledge is only achieved
through experience; and you must be careful, because every experience
of reality has many levels, and the first one may not be relevant, or
the one you need to know. Reality does not deceive you; you only
deceive yourself, by thinking you know more than you do. But if you
work patiently, frequently, and not in a hurry, your imagination will
become a doorway to discovery.</font></font></font></p>

<font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">This
skill in &quot;active&quot; imagination is a prerequisite for all
branches of magick, and people in any field which demands creativity,
flexibility and discipline will already have it highly developed. But
imagination, visualization, and dreaming are only tools, not ends in
themselves. They must, however, be practised and refined tools.
Dreaming and visualization, no matter how vivid, are not the same as
doing magick. Something must be learned. Magick is <b>using
knowledge</b>. These skills are the <i>doorways</i> to magick.</font></font></font></p>

<font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Imagination</b>
is a faculty which everyone possesses and uses. It is the root of
everything we do, or think we can do. It informs our moral decisions,
because we <i>imagine</i> the outcome of our actions; it informs
every choice we make, because we imagine its results, based upon
our<i>knowledge</i> of causality. No one can tell you how to imagine,
because you already do it all the time. <i>Everything you know is
your imagination</i>. But you can train your imagination to be
better. It can become clearer and more efficient. This skill is
called visualization.</font></font></font></p>

<font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Visualization</b>
is sustained and directed imagination. It is the same as fantasy.
Hearing or reading a story is a way in which we let our imagination
be informed by suggestions, and visualize for ourselves the rest.
Such visualizations are not usually very deep because the suggestions
keep coming, making it seem effortless, as if the author is doing all
the work for us. But the satisfaction we feel in entertainment is due
precisely to our depth of engagement in it. It is a form of active
participation, where we learn on a different level than that of
simply reasoning out a problem. You have only to think of the debates
friends have after a movie. If it were only passive information,
everyone should have gotten an identical message and have a similar
response. But because we are really doing active work in watching a
movie, and we are all different people, we come to learn quite
different things. We each <i>see</i> the movie differently.</font></font></font></p>

<font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Visualization
is the most important general skill you can possess. It is by <i>seeing</i>,
by <i>sensing</i> and <i>feeling</i>, that you have become conscious,
and magick is <i>consciouness in action</i>. The only way to become
more conscious is to learn to see more; never think you know
everything. The most hopeful feeling in the world is sometimes utter
confusion - at least you know you're not deluding yourself! The best
thing you can know is how to ask better questions. Magick is a
technique for answering old questions, and learning what to ask next.
Magick is <i>educating the spirit</i>.</font></font></font></p>

<font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Dreaming</b>
is the one form of magickal consciousness that everyone experiences
<i>as such</i>. You can do anything in dreams. Reality is an
undulation of forms, and every form grows tired and dissolves; this
is daily called sleep, and in terms of those similar forms that watch
you and compare themselves to you, death. Death and sleep are the
same reality; part of you relaxes, dissolves; part of you remains
conscious. An important technique of magick is to remain conscious
<i>while you fall asleep</i>. Another way is to wake up during a
dream, still in the dream. In both cases, the difficulty is in
keeping your body asleep when you enter into the less bound world of
the dream. But when you master it, &quot;lucid dreaming&quot; will
become the most important magickal skill you have, reaching into all
aspects of magickal work from divination and spellcasting to
traveling in the spirit and speaking with Gods and the dead.</font></font></font></p>

<font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Sleep
and dreaming are the most extreme types of trances you can
experience. You do not need their intensity for most magick.
<i>Possession</i> and <i>ecstasy</i>, trances of a different type,
are not the same kind of magick as visualization. Possession is not
<i>your</i> magick, but the will of the entity who moves you. Your
possession may be magick for the community you serve, but you
remember and learn nothing directly from the experience. In
possession you become a tool of magick. Ecstasy, conversely, is
orgasm, conception and ultimately birth on a different plane; it is
<i>your</i>ecstasy. However, ecstasy is only the by-product of the
working, whose goal is union. But aim beyond the ecstasy as well,
fitting the arrow of desire to the bowstring of pleasure.</font></font></font></p>

<font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">In
sleep then, you should aim not only to dream, but to dream for a
purpose. The reality you find yourself in will then become a trusted
ally in your quest, instead of a bully in the way.</font></font></font></p>

when you finish the ritual and realize you've forgotten about your
body sitting over there. It is also a very good sign when you find
yourself doing the ritual in your dreams. The body you develop while
concentrating on visualization is your primary vehicle for magickal
exploration.</span></span></span></font></font></font></span></p>
