<b>Reshe Ishkari Mashmashuti
The Titles of the Works of Magic</b></center>
<br>
This text has been called "a magician's vade mecum," a handbook of the trade. It outlines what a magician, or ashipu, of the 8th century b.c.e. was supposed to know, or have on hand for reference. Reshe Ishkari Mashmashuti lists books, rituals and other techniques of the ashipu's profession. Archeologists and scholars have recovered a large part of this material, and I have tried to put most of it on this site. Because KAR 44 forms a kind of table of contents to the study of Babylonian Magick, I will link the texts mentioned as they appear on the site.
