<h1 class="western" align="center">Basics of Babylonian Magic</h1>
<p>Here is how to get started in practising Babylonian Magick.</p>
<p>The first two things you will need are:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">time 
	</p>
	<li><p>patience.</p>
</ul>
<p>If you have these two, you can get started right away.</p>
<p align="center"><b>A Story</b></p>
<p>See yourself standing alone in the desert. It is sunset. You are a
traveller from a far off land. You have been travelling for so long,
through so many lands and peoples, that your original home is only a
memory. Overhead the bright stars are beginning to twinkle
mysteriously, and the waxing half moon beckons brightly above you.
You are weary, and in the gathering gloom you are looking for shelter
from from the cold and sand. In the dark distance ahead you seem to
see a dim glow, over the dunes. Faint strains of music, and human
voices coming disconnected fragments, reach your ears, as if some
festival were going on. The odor of sheep and goats, and the salty
smoke of cooking meat wafts past your nostrils. Although tired, you
press on to the promise of an oasis, a place to rest and refresh.<br>If
it's a festival, you're thinking, they will welcome travellers, and
there will be plenty to eat and drink.</p>
<p>As you go towards the brightening glow, the voices get louder, the
music wilder, sounds and smells mingling in the chilly air, your body
nervous with excitement, your imagination racing with ideas of what
you might find on the other side of the dunes..... you trudge on
through the sand, and as you are about to reach the top of the last
dune, a strange thought enters your mind - why does it all seem so
familiar? With your heart pounding in your ears you reach the summit
and see ......</p>
<p>.........nothing. There isn't a sound: the light, the music, the
voices, the inviting smells and the promise of warmth all gone.
Nothing but the chilly breeze biting your cheek.</p>
<p>You tighten your coat around you and begin to descend the dune,
when your foot strikes something in the sand, as hard as a rock. It
is warm. You bend down to see what it is, and, clearing away sand you
find a single <i>brick</i>, almost too hot, as if it were just taken
from a fire. You pick it up and, holding it close, notice that it has
writing on it. Angling it in the pale moonlight, you try to read it
and see inscribed what looks like........... <i>your own name</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Imagination is the doorway to magick</b></i>. Reading this
story, you undoubtedly filled in many details for yourself, which are
not in the story and which are very different from the way <i>I</i>
imagined it. But imagine it we both did. My power to evoke images in
your mind is one form of <b>casting a spell</b>. The word spell means
exactly that - to tell a story, to make a word, to <i>spell</i>. The
purpose of the spell above was to enchant and entertain, and to
illustrate the very simplest and most very profound, power of magick,
which is to make you see and believe something that is very different
from what you normally see and believe, or what you think you <i>should</i>
see and believe. And in seeing something different, you may come to
new <b>knowledge</b>.</p>
<p>All arts are spells, and some arts are stronger than others; these
overwhelm the senses, they induce <i><b>wonder</b></i>. In the moment
of wonder, when your view of how things happen is temporarily
challenged and suspended, a doorway opens - a doorway where anything
seems possible. Sometimes, with the uncanny and the weird, this is
frightening. But a magician is someone who lives permanently in a
state of wonder, and tries to understand these things <i>without
fear</i>. With understanding comes knowledge, and with knowledge,
power. The stage magician induces wonder only in others, but real
magick also induces wonder in ourselves - it educates and leads us
outward. The complete magician must be able to do both.
